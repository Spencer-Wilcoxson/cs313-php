	  <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
	  <p id="aboutMe">My Name is Spencer. I hail from the kingdom of Seattle. I am currently a junior at BYU-I 
	  where I am studying Business Management. I enjoy doing various outdoor activites such as snowboarding, rock climbing, 
	  and riding motorcycles. Besides this there really isn't much else to me.</p>
